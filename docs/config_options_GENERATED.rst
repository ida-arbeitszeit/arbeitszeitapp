.. py:data:: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
   :no-index:

   The address of the database used for persistence. The application has been tested with PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.

.. py:data:: ACCEPTABLE_RELATIVE_ACCOUNT_DEVIATION
   :no-index:

   This integer defines the "relative deviation" from the ideal account balance of zero that is still deemed acceptable, expressed in percent and calculated relative to the expected transfer value of this account.
   Example: Company XY has an absolute deviation of minus 1000 hours on its account for means of production (PRD account). Because it has filed plans with total costs for means of production of 10000 hours (=the sum of expected transfer value), its relative deviation is 10%.
   Unacceptable high deviations might get labeled as such or highlighted by the application.

   Default: ``33``
