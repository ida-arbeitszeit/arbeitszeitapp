About The App
---------------

Arbeitszeitapp is a plattform to exchange services and products on the
basis of working time. It is designed as a Web app to be self-hosted by communities
or organizations. A test instance is running on
https://demo-app.arbeitszeitrechnung.org/.

Companies usually calculate with labour time internally, but use
money externally. This app extends labour time planning and
calculation beyond company boundaries, enabling networks to
exchanges products based on labour time.

It offers planning tools for companies and communities, and work 
time management for companies and workers. Plans can be approved, 
products published, and work or consumption recorded.

This application implements a theory (`"Arbeitszeitrechnung"
<https://aaap.be/Pages/Transition-en-Fundamental-Principles-1930.html>`_)
elaborated in the 1920s by members of a German working-class movement.


The Arbeitszeitapp Collective
-----------------------------

We are a group of programmers closely associated with the `IDA association <arbeitszeit.noblogs.org>`_. To coordinate our work, we meet once a week for half an hour online. If needed, we can also meet in person at the IDA office in Berlin. Otherwise, we communicate via a mailing list and use the Github Issue tracker. 

We are always looking for people who want to help us improve the app. If you are interested in contributing, please proceed to the :doc:`how_to_contribute` page for more information on how to get involved.
