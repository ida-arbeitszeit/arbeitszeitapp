Introduction
============

The workers control app is a platform to exchange services and products on the
basis of working time. It is designed as a Web app to be self-hosted by communities
or organizations. A test instance is running on
https://demo-app.arbeitszeitrechnung.org/.

Companies usually calculate with labour time internally, but use
money externally. This app extends labour time planning and
calculation beyond company boundaries, enabling networks to
exchanges products based on labour time.

It offers planning tools for companies and communities, and work 
time management for companies and workers. Plans can be approved, 
products published, and work or consumption recorded.

This application implements a theory (`"Labour time accounting"
<https://aaap.be/Pages/Transition-en-Fundamental-Principles-1930.html>`_)
elaborated in the 1920s by members of a German working-class movement.
