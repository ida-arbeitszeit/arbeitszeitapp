Introduction
============

Description
------------

Arbeitszeitapp is a plattform to exchange services and products on the
basis of working time. It is designed as a Web app to be self-hosted by communities
or organizations. A test instance is running on
https://demo-app.arbeitszeitrechnung.org/.


Theory
-----------

Companies usually calculate with labour time internally, but switch to
money on the market. This app extends planning and labour time
calculation beyond the company boundaries and supports networks that
exchanges products on the basis of labour time.

It provides a planning interface for companies and communities as well
as a work time management interface for companies and workers. Plans can get
filed and approved, products can get published, work and consumption can get registered.

This application implements a theory (`"Arbeitszeitrechnung"
<https://aaap.be/Pages/Transition-en-Fundamental-Principles-1930.html>`_)
elaborated in the 1920s by members of a German working-class movement.


User Roles
----------

There are three user roles:

* **Companies** can file plans for each product (or service) they
  offer. A plan describes a product and defines how much working time
  it will cost.

* **Members** are workers in companies. They receive work certificates
  for their worked hours. They can use them to consume products and 
  services.

* **Accountants** are delegates of the cooperating network of
  companies. They can approve company plans based on collectively
  agreed criteria.
